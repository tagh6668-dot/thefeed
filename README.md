## Install the app

*For anyone who just wants to read feeds and chat — you don't need a server, just import a config into the client.*

Download the client for your platform from the latest release — pick the mirror that's reachable for you: **[GitHub](https://github.com/sartoopjj/thefeed/releases/latest)** · **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sartoopjj/thefeed/-/releases)**.

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Android** (7.0+) | APK. Pick `arm64-v8a` (phones since ~2017) or `armeabi-v7a` (older 32-bit only). Installing the wrong ABI installs but won't run. |
| **iOS** (13+) | Install via **[TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/J6bfxDdZ)**. App Store build is planned; you can also build from source under [ios/](ios/) — see [Build from source](#build-from-source). |
| **Windows** (10/11) | The `.exe` is **unsigned**, so SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"* and Defender may quarantine it — a known false positive for DNS-tunneling tools, **not malware**. Click **More info → Run anyway**; restore from Defender → *Protection history* if removed; verify the SHA-256 from the release page if unsure. |
| **macOS** | Universal `.dmg` (Intel + Apple Silicon), drag-installs `Thefeed.app`. Unsigned, so on first launch either right-click → **Open**, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Thefeed.app`. |
| **Linux / Termux** | `thefeed-client` binary — run it and open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. |

Then open **Settings → Configs** and import a config (or paste your domain + passphrase). DNS resolvers are managed in the **Resolver** tab — a shared Bank used by all configs, plus a Scanner to find more.

**Public configs to try:** [@thefeedconfig](https://t.me/thefeedconfig).

## Run a server

*For operators who host feeds for others.* The server runs **outside** the censored network, pulls from Telegram / X, and answers encrypted DNS queries. Setup is two steps: **(1) DNS records**, then **(2) install**.

### 1. DNS records

You need one **A** record and one **NS** delegation. Example: your server IP is `203.0.113.10` and your domain is `example.com`.

| # | Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
|---|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | A  | `ns.example.com` | `203.0.113.10`   | Point a hostname at your server |
| 2 | NS | `t.example.com`  | `ns.example.com` | Delegate the **feed** subdomain to your server |
| 3 *(optional)* | NS | `c.example.com` | `ns.example.com` | Delegate a **messenger** subdomain — only if you enable [chat](#messenger) |

Records **1–2** are required for the feed. Record **3** is only needed for the optional [messenger](#messenger), which must use a **separate** subdomain from the feed (e.g. `c.example.com`).

### 2. Install the server

With DNS in place, install with the **script** or with **Docker**.

#### Option A — install script (Linux + systemd)

The one-liner auto-detects a reachable mirror (GitHub first, then GitLab); pass `--gitlab` to force GitLab.

```bash
# GitHub mirror
sudo bash -c "$(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sartoopjj/thefeed/main/scripts/install.sh)"

# GitLab mirror (use while the GitHub account is unavailable)
sudo bash -c "$(curl -Ls https://gitlab.com/sartoopjj/thefeed/-/raw/main/scripts/install.sh)" -- --gitlab
```

The script downloads the latest binary, asks for your domain / passphrase / channels / X accounts, asks whether to use Telegram login (recommended: **No** — public channels work without it), and sets up a systemd service. Re-run it any time to **update**.

Other actions (pipe the script to `sudo bash -s -- <flag>`):

| Flag | Action |
|------|--------|
| `--version v0.9.2` (or `-v`) | Install a specific tag (rollback) |
| `--pre` | Install the newest pre-release (beta / rc) |
| `--list` | List recent releases |
| `--login` | Re-run Telegram login |
| `--config` | Print the import URI (domain, key, `sk=` server key, bootstrap resolvers) |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the service |

#### Option B — Docker

No Go toolchain needed. Base image `alpine:3.21` (~23 MB), runs as non-root `thefeed` (UID 1000).

```bash
# 1. Configure — set THEFEED_DOMAIN and THEFEED_KEY (uncomment Telegram vars if you need private channels)
cp .env.example .env && nano .env

# 2. Add your channels
mkdir -p data
cp configs/channels.txt data/
cp configs/x_accounts.txt data/   # optional

# 3. Build and run (listens on :5300/udp inside the container)
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f

# 4. Print the client import config (the thefeed:// URI — domain, key, server key sk=,
#    resolvers) to hand to your users, just like the script prints at the end:
docker compose run --rm server --print-config --data-dir /data --domain YOUR_DOMAIN --key YOUR_KEY
```

Then set up the [port 53 redirect](#port-53) below. For private channels, do a one-time interactive login first:

```bash
docker compose run -it --rm server --login-only --data-dir /data \
  --domain YOUR_DOMAIN --key YOUR_KEY \
  --api-id YOUR_API_ID --api-hash YOUR_HASH --phone YOUR_PHONE
# then remove --no-telegram from docker-compose.yml, add the Telegram flags, and `docker compose up -d`
```

### Port 53

The server must receive **external** DNS on UDP **53**, but binding `:53` directly conflicts with `systemd-resolved`. So it listens on an unprivileged port (`:5300`) and you redirect external `:53` to it with `iptables`. Local DNS on the host keeps working — only packets arriving on the external interface are redirected.

```bash
# Replace eth0 with your interface (check: ip a)
sudo iptables  -I INPUT -p udp --dport 5300 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables  -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5300
sudo ip6tables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 5300 -j ACCEPT
sudo ip6tables -t nat -I PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5300

# Persist across reboots (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install -y iptables-persistent && sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

**Undo instantly** if anything breaks:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5300
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p udp --dport 5300 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

Quick sanity checks: `ss -ulnp | grep ':53 '` (expect only `systemd-resolved` on `127.0.0.53`), `dig +short google.com @127.0.0.53` (local DNS still works), `iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING -n | grep 5300` (redirect active).

### Managing the service

```bash
systemctl status thefeed-server
systemctl restart thefeed-server
journalctl -u thefeed-server -f

sudo vi /opt/thefeed/data/channels.txt   # edit channels, then:
sudo systemctl restart thefeed-server
```

The server also renders a terminal dashboard from its hourly reports (`<data-dir>/dns_hourly.jsonl`) — serves nothing on the network, just reads the data dir:

```bash
thefeed-server --data-dir /srv/thefeed --report                 # snapshot
thefeed-server --data-dir /srv/thefeed --report --report-refresh 5s   # live
```

It shows total / channel-fetch / metadata / media / chat query counts, per-channel and per-domain aggregates, and chat stats.

### Server flags

Key flags (also settable via env vars, e.g. `THEFEED_DOMAIN`, `THEFEED_KEY`, `THEFEED_ALLOW_MANAGE`):

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--data-dir` | `./data` | Data directory (channels, session, cache, config) |
| `--domain` | | DNS feed domain **(required)** |
| `--key` | | Encryption passphrase **(required)** |
| `--extra-domains` | | Comma-separated extra feed sub-domains (load spread + resilience) |
| `--chat-domains` | | Enable the [messenger](#messenger) on these sub-domains (separate from feed) |
| `--no-telegram` | `false` | Run without Telegram login (public channels only) |
| `--api-id` / `--api-hash` / `--phone` | | Telegram credentials (private channels) |
| `--login-only` | `false` | Authenticate to Telegram, save session, exit |
| `--listen` | `:5300` | DNS listen address |
| `--msg-limit` | `15` | Max messages fetched per channel |
| `--fetch-interval` | `10` | Fetch cycle in minutes (min 3) |
| `--allow-manage` | `false` | Allow remote send / channel management (leave off unless trusted) |
| `--padding` | `32` | Max random padding bytes (anti-DPI; 0 = off) |
| `--x-rss-instances` | `nitter.net,…` | Comma-separated X RSS base URLs |
| `--dns-media-enabled` | `false` | Serve media over the slow DNS relay |
| `--github-relay-enabled` | `false` | Serve media over the fast GitHub relay (needs `--github-relay-token` / `-repo`) |
| `--report` | | Render the terminal dashboard and exit |
| `--version` | | Show version and exit |

Full media-relay flags are in [How it works → Media relays](#media-relays).

## Messenger

An **optional**, standalone store-and-forward messenger between users of the same server — it never touches Telegram. Enable it by giving the server one or more dedicated sub-domains (with a matching [NS record](#1-dns-records), separate from the feed domains):

```bash
thefeed-server ... --chat-domains c.example.com     # or THEFEED_CHAT_DOMAINS=c.example.com
```

- **End-to-end encrypted** — only the two users can read a message; the server stores opaque blobs and verifies senders without reading anything. Contact names never leave the device.
- **Identity** — the client generates a recovery code locally; your address is 20 characters derived from it. Share the address out-of-band; the same recovery code works on any server.
- **Fail-closed** — chat activates only when the profile pins the server key (`sk=`) and the server's signed chat capability verifies. A signed bit in the feed metadata lets a keyless client tell you *"this server has a messenger — re-import the config with its key"* instead of failing silently.
- **Abuse limits** (advertised to clients): `--chat-send-per-hour` (30), `--chat-inbox-cap` (50), `--chat-per-pair-cap` (10), `--chat-max-msg-bytes` (500); undelivered messages expire after `--chat-ttl-hours` (72). `--chat-enabled=false` keeps the domains but advertises chat as disabled.

In the client, open **Chat** from the bottom nav. ✓ = stored on the server, ✓✓ = picked up by the recipient; matching safety emojis on both devices confirm the conversation is secure.

```

**Server** (outside the censored network): connects to Telegram and reads configured channels; fetches public X posts via RSS-compatible mirrors (no login); serves feed metadata and small media as **encrypted DNS TXT** responses with random padding (anti-DPI). Login once, run forever; `--no-telegram` reads public channels with no credentials. Optional **multi-domain** and **[messenger](#messenger)** modes. All state in one data directory.

**Client** (inside the censored network): a browser-based web UI (RTL/Farsi, VazirMatn font) that sends encrypted DNS queries through a shared **Resolver Bank** — resolvers are found via the Scanner, imported, or entered manually, and scored by success-rate + latency so healthy ones are preferred. **Scatter mode** fans a query out to several resolvers and takes the fastest. Media downloads are relay-aware and hash/size-verified. Includes the [messenger](#messenger), per-channel auto-update, new-message indicators, and a live DNS query log.

### Protocol

All communication is encrypted (AES-256) and rides standard DNS TXT queries/responses with variable padding and per-resolver scoring, so it blends with normal DNS. Message data is deflate-compressed before encryption; each query is independent (no session state on the wire).

### Media relays

Messages with photos, files, GIFs, audio, and video can be cached on the server and downloaded over the same channel. The server dedupes each file (by upstream id + content hash), pushes bytes to every enabled relay, and adds a small header to the message text:

```
[IMAGE]<size>:<flags>:<dnsCh>:<dnsBlk>:<crc32>[:<filename>]
optional caption
```

`<flags>` is a comma-separated list of per-relay availability bits (`1`=available, `0`=not): slot 0 = DNS, slot 1 = GitHub, future relays append; older clients ignore unknown slots. Each relay is independent — the same file can be served via several at once. Clients prefer the fastest available, retry on failure, and ask before falling back to a slower path. Block 0 of every DNS-cached file starts with a 16-byte header (CRC32 + version + compression byte + reserved) that the client verifies before delivering bytes. Downloads are cached client-side (IndexedDB, 7 days) and on the local client (`<dataDir>/media-cache/`, 7 days).

Two relays ship today:

- **DNS relay** (slow, censorship-resistant, off by default) — bytes split across DNS blocks. Default cap 100 KB.
- **GitHub relay** (fast, off by default) — bytes uploaded to a repo, pulled over plain HTTPS; needs a PAT with `contents:write`. Objects land at `<repo>/<sanitised-domain>/<size>_<crc32>`. Default cap 15 MB.

| Flag | Env | Default | Notes |
|------|-----|---------|-------|
| `--dns-media-enabled` | `THEFEED_DNS_MEDIA_ENABLED` | `false` | toggle DNS relay |
| `--dns-media-max-size` | `THEFEED_DNS_MEDIA_MAX_SIZE_KB` | `100` KB | per-file cap |
| `--dns-media-compression` | `THEFEED_DNS_MEDIA_COMPRESSION` | `gzip` | `none` / `gzip` / `deflate` |
| `--github-relay-enabled` | `THEFEED_GITHUB_RELAY_ENABLED` | `false` | toggle GitHub relay |
| `--github-relay-token` | `THEFEED_GITHUB_RELAY_TOKEN` | — | PAT, `contents:write` |
| `--github-relay-repo` | `THEFEED_GITHUB_RELAY_REPO` | — | `owner/repo` |
| `--github-relay-branch` | `THEFEED_GITHUB_RELAY_BRANCH` | `main` | branch for relay objects |
| `--github-relay-max-size` | `THEFEED_GITHUB_RELAY_MAX_SIZE_KB` | `15360` KB | per-file cap |

## Security

**Two-part access control:**

- **Encryption passphrase (`--key`)** — required on both server and client. Anyone with it can read all channel messages (including private channels); share it only with people you trust.
- **Remote management (`--allow-manage`)** — when enabled, anyone with the passphrase can, from the client: **send messages through the server's Telegram account** (into channels / private chats — this is Telegram sending via the operator's logged-in account, and is *completely separate* from the end-to-end [messenger](#messenger)), and **change the feed's channel list** (add or remove the channels shown in the feed). Off by default; enable only on trusted servers.
- **Client web password (`--password`)** — HTTP Basic Auth on the web UI. Local protection only; it does **not** affect DNS-level access.

**Properties:** end-to-end AES-256 in both directions · random padding defeats size analysis · each query independent (no wire session state) · writes gated by `--allow-manage` · Telegram 2FA prompted interactively (never stored in args) · session file `0600`.

> **⚠️ Never share your passphrase publicly.** Anyone who has it can run their own client and read all your messages — there is no way to prevent that. The `--password` flag only guards the web UI on your own machine.

The optional [messenger](#messenger) is separately end-to-end encrypted per conversation and independent of the feed passphrase.

## Build from source

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.26+, and (for private channels) Telegram API credentials from <https://my.telegram.org>.

```bash
make build          # build server + client into ./build
make build-server   # server only
make build-client   # client only
make test           # tests with the race detector
make build-all      # cross-compile all platforms (incl. Android)
make vet            # go vet
```

**Run the server** (see [flags](#server-flags)):

```bash
./build/thefeed-server --data-dir ./data --domain t.example.com --key "passphrase" --no-telegram --listen ":5300"
# private channels: add --login-only once (with --api-id/--api-hash/--phone), then run without it
```

**Run the client:** `./build/thefeed-client` (creates `./thefeeddata/`, opens `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). Options: `--data-dir`, `--port` (8080), `--password`. Per-config options (resolvers, scatter, rate limit, timeout) are set in the web UI, not via flags.

**macOS:** `make mac-dmg` → `build/Thefeed.app` + universal `.dmg`. Data lives under `~/Library/Application Support/Thefeed`; a menu-bar item offers **Open / Quit**.

**Android APK:**

```bash
make build-android-arm64
cp build/thefeed-client-android-arm64 android/app/src/main/assets/thefeed-client
cd android && gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10.2 && ./gradlew assembleDebug
# → android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

**iOS:** wraps the Go client as a gomobile-bound xcframework consumed by a SwiftUI app under `ios/`. The server runs in-process on `127.0.0.1:<random-port>`, foreground only. Needs Xcode 15+, Go 1.26+, gomobile (`go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest && gomobile init`).

```bash
make ios-bind    # build Mobile.xcframework (device + Simulator)
make ios-build   # build the app for the Simulator
```

Then open `ios/Thefeed.xcodeproj` in Xcode to run on a device.

**Releases:** pushing a tag starting with `v` triggers a CI build + release. A tag containing `-` (e.g. `v1.4.0-rc1`) is marked pre-release automatically. Assets include server/client binaries for every platform plus the Android APKs (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`).

## Reference

### Config file formats

All optional, in the data directory; `#` starts a comment and blank lines are ignored.

- **`channels.txt`** — public Telegram channels, one `@username` per line.
- **`x_accounts.txt`** — public X (Twitter) usernames, one per line.
- **`private_channels.txt`** — private-channel invite links, one per line. Requires Telegram login — the server joins each channel at startup, then fetches it like any other. Accepts `https://t.me/+…`, `t.me/joinchat/…`, `tg://join?invite=…`, or the bare invite hash.

```
# channels.txt      # x_accounts.txt    # private_channels.txt
@VahidOnline        Vahid               https://t.me/+aBcDeF123456
```

### The web UI

A Telegram-style shell with a **bottom navigation bar** across five sections:

- **Feed** — channel/X feed grouped by type (Public/X/Private), native RTL/Farsi rendering, a floating composer (send to channels/private chats when Telegram is connected), per-channel new-message badges, media-tag highlighting, in-channel search, and a live DNS query log. **Saved Messages** (encrypted local notes + bookmarks) lives here.
- **Mirror** (Telemirror) — a read-only, Telegram-web-style mirror of channels with aspect-ratio-stable image/album rendering.
- **Chat** — the end-to-end-encrypted [messenger](#messenger).
- **Resolver** — the shared **Bank**, your named resolver **lists**, and the **Scanner** in one place. The Scanner probes IPs / CIDRs (e.g. `5.1.0.0/16`) or domains to find DNS servers that can reach your server; results sort by latency, expand a working resolver's /24, and can be applied to a config directly. A one-click preset loads a curated CIDR list.
- **Settings** — **Display** (theme, font, language, wallpaper), **Connection** (query mode, rate limit, scatter, timeout, password, debug), **Storage** (disk-cache budget), **Backup** (encrypted export/import), **About**, and **Configs** (import/manage, with ready-made starter configs). Theme follows the device by default. All fields auto-save.

### X fetch safety

X posts are fetched via RSS/XML only. Instance URLs are validated (`http`/`https`, host-only), response size is capped and timeouts enforced, and on a `403`/failure the server tries the next configured instance. Set your own trusted mirrors with `--x-rss-instances`.
